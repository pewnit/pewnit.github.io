      <h3>This project is targeted at businesses and companies for improving their recycling programs. The clients would be satisfied with a functioning automated garbage disposal system that would be placed in their workplace. </h3>
      <h3>We did this using Google's Vision API, React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, OpenCV, and Python. We use an express server to run our backend for both, the website and the Python program running the machine to communicate with the database. </h3>
      <h3>We also used Google's vision API to detect garbage using the webcam attached to the machine running the Python script to be able to detect the object being thrown and the type of garbage being thrown. This allows us to sort the garbage accurately. </h3>
